## Good Practices

- Naming Branches: The development branches must be created with the story or task code, e.g. `XXX-123`.
- Naming Branches: Feature branch must be created with the accronym `feature/` and then the story code, e.g. `feature/XXX-123`.
- Commit Messages: All commit messages must follow semantic release standard, e.g. `feat(source): message of release`.
